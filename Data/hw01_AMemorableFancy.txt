      A bird was singing while perched on a branch of a tree.  This caught the 
      attention of a cat nearby who climbed onto the roof of a house near the 
      tree. Stealthily, the cat moved closer, then pounced on the limb and 
      attempted to sink its teeth into the bird's throat. The bird struggled and 
      managed to break free and fluttered to the ground below. 

      Quickly, the cat pounced on the bird again, but as it did, the bird turned 
      into a puppy, who began growing and growling. The cat redoubled the attack 
      but the puppy had become stronger and so shook off the cat. 
      And looking around in its glistening youth, the puppy walked away.
